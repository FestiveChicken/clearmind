## üß† 1. Summarizer API

**Purpose:** Condenses long passages of text into concise summaries or bullet points.  

**Namespace:** `Summarizer`  
**Used in:** `logic.js`, `content.js`  

**Availability check:**
```js
if ('Summarizer' in self) { /* supported */ }
const availability = await Summarizer.availability();
```

**Modes:**
- `type: "key-points"` ‚Äì returns bullet summaries  
- `format: "markdown"` ‚Äì preserves structure  
- `length: "medium"` ‚Äì balanced summary length  

When the model is not yet downloaded, ClearMind automatically handles model download progress and retries once it becomes available.

## ‚úçÔ∏è 2. Proofreader API

**Purpose:** Detects and corrects grammar, punctuation, and style issues in English text.  

**Namespace:** `Proofreader`  
**Used in:** `logic.js`, `content.js`  

**Availability check:**
```js
if ('Proofreader' in self) { /* supported */ }
const availability = await Proofreader.availability();
```

**Options:**
- `expectedInputLanguages: ['en']`  
- `expectedOutputLanguages: ['en']`  

Returns a set of text corrections (`startIndex`, `endIndex`, `replacement`) which are automatically applied to reconstruct a cleaned version of the original text.

## üåê 3. Translator API

**Purpose:** Translates text locally between supported language pairs using on-device AI models.  

**Namespace:** `Translator`  
**Used in:** `logic.js`, `content.js`  

**Availability check:**
```js
if ('Translator' in self) { /* supported */ }
const availability = await Translator.availability({
  sourceLanguage: 'en',
  targetLanguage: 'es',
});
```

**Automatic model download:**  
ClearMind automatically starts downloading the translation model if it isn‚Äôt available and continues to translation once ready ‚Äî **no second click required.**

**Default configuration:** English ‚Üí Spanish  
(Support for other target languages planned.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Origin Trial Setup (for Chrome Extensions)

To enable these APIs before full public release, ClearMind uses a **Chrome Origin Trial token**.

Add the token to your `manifest.json`:
```json
"trial_tokens": [
  "YOUR_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKEN_HERE"
]
```

Chrome will automatically grant access to the **Summarizer**, **Proofreader**, and **Translator** APIs for the extension‚Äôs origin:
```
chrome-extension://<your-extension-id>/
```
